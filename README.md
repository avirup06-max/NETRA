# NETRA
Engineered NETRA â€“ wearable tech guiding the blind with smart sensing.

Netra is a wearable assistive technology designed to support visually impaired individuals by providing real-time obstacle detection and GPS-based location tracking. The system integrates ultrasonic sensors, a GPS+GSM module (A9G), and a buzzer to deliver both spatial awareness and emergency communication.

*Features*

Obstacle Detection: Utilizes three ultrasonic sensors to detect nearby objects in multiple directions.

Location Tracking: Sends live GPS coordinates via SMS in a Google Maps-compatible format using the A9G module.

Alert System: Triggers a buzzer alert when an object is detected within a predefined distance threshold.

Motor Feedback : Vibration motors can be used for haptic feedback, adjusting intensity based on proximity.

Working Principle

Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance to nearby obstacles.

If an object is within a critical range, the buzzer is activated and motors vibrate to alert the wearer.

The GPS module collects and parses location data at set intervals.

Once a set number of valid GPS readings are collected, an SMS containing a Google Maps link is sent via the GSM module to a predefined mobile number.

Usage

Mount the sensors on the cap facing forward, left, and right.

Upload the code to the microcontroller.

Power on the device and wait for GSM/GPS initialization.

The system will start monitoring the environment and periodically transmit the location.
